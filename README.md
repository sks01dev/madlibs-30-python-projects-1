## 🖥️ Sample Output

Here’s a sample story created with **Madlibs.py**:

```
Enter a noun: cat
Enter an adjective: fluffy
Enter a verb: dance
Enter another noun: dog
Enter another verb: sing

Once upon a time, there was a fluffy cat who loved to dance all day long.

One day, dog walked into the room and caught the cat in the act.

dog: "What are you doing?"

cat: "I'm just dancing, what's the big deal?"

dog: "Well, it's not every day that you see a cat dancing in the middle of the day."

cat: "I guess you're right. Maybe I should take a break."

dog: "That's probably a good idea. Why don't we go sing instead?"

cat: "Sure, that sounds like fun!"

And so, dog and the cat went off to sing and had a great time. The end.
